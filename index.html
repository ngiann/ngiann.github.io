	<h2> <p style="color:#FF5733">Hi there, this is my personal research page </p> </h2>
	<p>My name is Nikos Gianniotis and I work as a staff scientist at the  <a href="https://www.h-its.org/research/ain">Astroinformatics Group</a>, at the Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies (HITS). </p>
	<p>I work on applications of machine learning in astronomy. My research interests revolve around the topics of dimensionality reduction, Bayesian inference and probabilistic modelling. I am a very keen user of the Julia programming language. </p>
